# cfis-modul-git

Welcome to the cfis-modul-git repository! This repository contains a set of exercises and resources designed to help you learn and practice Git, a powerful version control system. At this point, you have received a lecture on Git and have been introduced to the basics of version control. This repository is intended to provide you with hands-on experience and practical exercises to reinforce your understanding of Git concepts.

### Travel through history

To start this exercise, go to the branch `travel-through-history/main`. More instructions are available in the `README.md` file in the branch. The goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the Git history and learn how to navigate through it. You will learn how to use commands like `git log`, `git show`, and `git diff` to explore the commit history, view changes made in each commit, and understand the differences between commits.

### Stashing

To start this exercise, go to the branch `stashing/main`. More instructions are available in the `README.md` file in the branch. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use Git stash to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed. You will learn how to create a stash, apply it later, and manage multiple stashes.

### Solving merge conflicts

To start this exercise, go to the branch `solving-merge-conflicts/main`. More instructions are available in the `README.md` file in the branch. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to resolve merge conflicts that may arise when merging branches. You will learn how to identify conflicts, use Git's conflict markers, and manually resolve conflicts in code files.

### Rebasing

To start this exercise, go to the branch `rebasing/main`. More instructions are available in the `README.md` file in the branch. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use Git rebase to integrate changes from one branch into another. You will learn how to perform a rebase, resolve conflicts that may arise during the process, and understand the differences between merging and rebasing.
