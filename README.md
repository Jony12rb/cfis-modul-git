In this branch there exist a file called `information.txt` which contains just some text. Some time ago, a new branch was created from the actual branch, called `solving-merge-conflicts/branch`. The contents of the file `information.txt` have diverged in both branches. The task is to merge the changes from the branch `solving-merge-conflicts/branch` into the current branch. The goal is to keep the changes from both branches.
